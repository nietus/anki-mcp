# anki-mcp

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@nietus/anki-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@nietus/anki-mcp)

MCP server for Anki. This server allows interaction with Anki through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables users to manage flashcards, decks, and review processes programmatically.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- AnkiConnect plugin installed and running in Anki.
- For audio features: Azure API key (set in `.env` file as `AZURE_API_KEY`) and Anki Media Directory (set as `ANKI_MEDIA_DIR`).

## Setup and Execution

Highly recommended to run locally, since AnkiConnect only works locally.

Was only tested on windows.

### Running locally via `npx`

If you only wish to use the tool and not develop the tool,
you may launch an MCP STDIO server locally using `npx`:

```sh
npx -y github:nietus/anki-mcp
```

This can be used in Desktop MCP clients such as Msty Studio or others.

### Running locally via source code

Alternatively, you can run locally via source code using these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nietus/anki-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Setup for Audio Features (If you want to use audio tools):**

   Create a .env file in the root directory with your Azure API key and Anki media directory:

   ```
   AZURE_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key_here
   ANKI_MEDIA_DIR=path/to/your/anki/media/directory
   ```
   
   For Anki media directory, use the path to your Anki collection.media folder. This is where audio files will be stored. If you have trouble, paste it directly into the code.
   
   - Windows example: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\User 1\collection.media`
   - macOS example: `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Anki2/User 1/collection.media`
   - Linux example: `/home/username/.local/share/Anki2/User 1/collection.media`
   
   **Note:** The ANKI_MEDIA_DIR is required for audio generation to work properly as Anki needs to find the audio files in its media collection.

5. **Integrate with Cursor settings (for local execution):**

   To run your local build of anki-mcp with Cursor, you need to tell Cursor how to start the server. Below are example configurations which you can access on cursor settings. Replace YOUR_USERNAME and adjust the path if you cloned anki-mcp to a different location than Downloads.

   **Windows:**

   ```json
   "anki": {
         "command": "cmd",
         "args": [
           "/c",
           "node",
           "c:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/anki-mcp/build/client.js"
       ]
   }
   ```

6. **Integrate with Claude Desktop using an `.mcpb` bundle:**

   The recommended way to use this server with Claude Desktop is to install it as an MCP extension bundle (`.mcpb` file).

   1. **Build and package the extension:**

      ```bash
      npm install
      npm run build
      npm run pack:mcpb
      ```

      This will produce a file at `dist/anki-mcp.mcpb`.

   2. **Install the bundle in Claude Desktop:**

      - Open Claude Desktop.
      - Go to **Settings → Extensions**.
      - Drag and drop the `dist/anki-mcp.mcpb` file into the Extensions panel.

      Claude will handle launching the server automatically when needed.

   3. **Configure environment variables:**

      When prompted during installation, provide your `AZURE_API_KEY` and `ANKI_MEDIA_DIR` (the path to your Anki `collection.media` folder). These are required for audio features and media file handling.

   That’s it! No manual configuration is needed—Claude Desktop will manage the server for you once the `.mcpb` bundle is installed.
   **macOS / Linux:**

 ```json
  "anki": {
        "command": "bash",
        "args": [
          "-c",
          "node /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/anki-mcp/build/client.js"
        ]
      }
  ```

### Create a Claude Desktop extension bundle (.mcpb)

If you want one-click installation inside Claude Desktop, you can package this server as an MCP bundle:

1. Install dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Generate the `.mcpb` bundle (requires the `@anthropic-ai/mcpb` CLI, which expects Node.js 18+):

   ```bash
   npm run pack:mcpb
   ```

The script stages the compiled server (`build/`), copies runtime dependencies, and produces `dist/anki-mcp.mcpb`. Drag that file into Claude Desktop's Settings → Extensions panel to install. When prompted, provide the Azure Speech API key and Anki media directory so audio tools can save files in your `collection.media` folder.

## Available Tools

To debug the tools, use

```
npm run inspector
```

The server provides the following tools for interacting with Anki:

- `update_cards`:

  - Description: After the user answers cards you've quizzed them on, use this tool to mark them answered and update their ease.
  - Input: An array of answers, each with `cardId` (number) and `ease` (number, 1-4).

- `add_card`:

  - Description: Create a NEW flashcard in Anki. Use ONLY for creating new cards, NOT for updating existing ones (will throw an error if the card already exists). For updating existing cards, use `update_note_fields` with the noteId instead. Note content uses HTML.
    - Line breaks: `<br>`
    - Code: `<pre style="background-color: transparent; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">`
    - Lists: `<ol>` and `<li>`
    - Bold: `<strong>`
    - Italic: `<em>`
  - Input:
    - `fields`: (object) An object where keys are field names (e.g., "Hanzi", "Pinyin") and values are their HTML content.
    - `modelName`: (string) The name of the Anki note type (model) to use.
    - `deckName`: (optional string) The name of the deck to add the card to. Defaults to the current deck or 'Default'.
    - `tags`: (optional array of strings) A list of tags to add to the note.

- `add_card_with_audio`:

  - Description: Create a NEW flashcard in Anki with automatically generated audio from Azure TTS. Use ONLY for creating new cards, NOT for updating existing ones (will throw an error if the card already exists). For updating audio on existing cards, use `update_card_with_audio` with the noteId instead.
  - Input:
    - `fields`, `modelName`, `deckName`, `tags`: Same as `add_card`.
    - `sourceField`: (string) Field name containing the text to generate audio from.
    - `audioField`: (string) Field name where the generated audio will be stored.
    - `language`: (optional string) Language code for TTS (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr'). Defaults to 'en'.
  - Supported languages: en, es, fr, de, it, ja, ko, pt, ru, zh, ar, nl, hi, tr, pl, sv, fi, da, no, cs, hu, el, he, th, vi, id, ms, ro.

- `update_card_with_audio`:

  - Description: Update an EXISTING card by generating audio from a specified field and adding it to an audio field. Use ONLY for cards that already exist (you must have the noteId). For creating new cards with audio, use `add_card_with_audio` instead.
  - Input:
    - `noteId`: (number) The ID of the Anki note to update.
    - `sourceField`: (string) Field name containing the text to generate audio from.

- `update_note_fields`:

  - Description: Update specific fields of an EXISTING Anki note. Use ONLY when you already have the noteId of an existing card. For creating new cards, use `add_card` instead.
